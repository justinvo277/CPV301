# CPV301 is a subject at FPT University

In this course, we learned traditional image processing algorithms, had access to OpenCV and used those algorithms in OpenCV.

Besides, we are assigned by our teachers to do exercises related to the algorithms we will learn and our task is to complete before the assigned deadline.

These are all the exercises I have done, in the process I have consulted from many different sources to complete them. Hope they can be of little help to you.
